# farsReport

##The purpose of this assessment is for you to combine your skills of creating, writing, documenting, and testing an R package with releasing that package on GitHub. In this assessment you'll be taking the R files from Week 2's assessment about documentation and putting that file in an R package.

##For this assessment you must:

-write a vignette to include in your package using knitr and R Markdown
-write at least one test written using testthat
-put your package on GitHub
-set up the repository so that the package can be checked and built on Travis
-Once your package has built on Travis and the build is passing with no errors, warnings, or notes - -you should add your Travis badge to the README.md file of your package repository.
